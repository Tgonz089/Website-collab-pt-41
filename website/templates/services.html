                "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                demoralized by
                the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
                trouble
                that
                are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will,
                which
                is
                the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain."
